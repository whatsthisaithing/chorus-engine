# Chorus Discord Bridge

A standalone Discord bridge service that allows Chorus Engine characters to participate in Discord conversations.

## Features

- **@mention Support**: Characters respond when mentioned in Discord
- **Direct Messages**: Characters can handle DMs
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains full context within each channel
- **User Tracking**: Remembers users across messages
- **Multi-User Memory Attribution**: Remembers which user said what (Phase 3)
- **Hot-Swappable Characters**: Change active character without restarting
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and abuse
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Survives API failures and recovers automatically
- **🆕 Fully Portable**: Run multiple bots simultaneously with different characters - [See Multi-Bot Setup](MULTI_BOT_SETUP.md)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Running Chorus Engine instance
- Discord Bot Token (see [Creating a Discord Bot](#creating-a-discord-bot))

### Single Bot Setup

Follow these steps to run one Discord bot:

> **Want to run multiple bots?** See [MULTI_BOT_SETUP.md](MULTI_BOT_SETUP.md) for running multiple characters simultaneously!

### Installation

The Discord Bridge creates a **self-contained virtual environment** with lightweight dependencies (~15MB).

#### Windows

1. **Run the installation script** (from the bridge directory):
   ```bash
   install_bridge.bat
   ```
   This creates a `.venv` folder with all dependencies.

2. **Edit configuration**:
   ```bash
   notepad .env
   # Add your Discord bot token: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
   
   notepad config.yaml
   # Set your character: character_id: "nova"
   ```

3. **Run the bridge**:
   ```bash
   start_bridge.bat
   ```

#### Linux/Mac

1. **Run the installation script** (from the bridge directory):
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_bridge.sh start_bridge.sh
   ./install_bridge.sh
   ```
   This creates a `.venv` folder with all dependencies.

2. **Edit configuration**:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   # Add your Discord bot token: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
   
   nano config.yaml
   # Set your character: character_id: "nova"
   ```

3. **Run the bridge**:
   ```bash
   ./start_bridge.sh
   ```

### Portability

The bridge is **fully portable**! You can:
- Copy the entire folder anywhere on your system
- Run multiple instances with different characters
- No shared resources or port conflicts

See [MULTI_BOT_SETUP.md](MULTI_BOT_SETUP.md) for running multiple bots.

## Creating a Discord Bot

See [scripts/create_bot.md](scripts/create_bot.md) for detailed instructions on creating a Discord bot and getting your token.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token (required)
- `CHORUS_API_URL`: Chorus Engine API URL (default: http://localhost:5000)
- `CHORUS_API_KEY`: Optional API key if Chorus requires authentication

### Application Settings (config.yaml)

- **discord.command_prefix**: Prefix for bot commands (default: "!")
- **discord.rate_limit**: Rate limiting settings
- **discord.max_history_fetch**: Number of messages to fetch for context (default: 10)
- **chorus.character_id**: Active character name (default: "nova")
- **chorus.timeout**: API request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- **bridge.log_level**: Logging verbosity (default: "INFO")

## Usage

### In Discord Channels

Mention the bot to get a response:
```
@NovaBot what do you think about AI ethics?
```

### In Direct Messages

Just send a message directly to the bot:
```
Hello! Can you help me with something?
```

### Bot Commands

- `!status`: Show bot status and statistics
- `!character`: Show active character information
- `!reload`: Reload configuration (admin only)

## Architecture

The bridge is a standalone service that:
1. Connects to Discord via discord.py
2. Communicates with Chorus Engine via HTTP API
3. Maintains conversation state in SQLite database
4. Maps Discord channels to Chorus conversations
5. Tracks users and provides context to Chorus

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond

1. Check that bot has proper permissions in Discord server
2. Verify `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is correct in `.env`
3. Ensure Chorus Engine is running and accessible
4. Check logs in `storage/bridge.log`

### "Rate limit exceeded" errors

Adjust rate limit settings in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
discord:
  rate_limit:
    per_user_cooldown: 5  # Increase cooldown
    global_limit: 5       # Reduce global limit
```

### Connection to Chorus Engine fails

1. Verify `CHORUS_API_URL` in `.env` is correct
2. Test Chorus Engine directly: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/characters`
3. Check network connectivity and firewall settings
